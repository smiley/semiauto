Semi-Auto Looter
================

A small add-on that auto-loots money & quest items.

Originally, I used auto-loot but my inventory became clogged by junk items VERY quickly, so I wrote a small add-on that will auto-loot only what I need.

If you don't want it to auto-loot some stuff (for whatever reason), you can configure it:

```
/looter money <ON|OFF> -- Toggles auto-loot for coins. (Not item currency)
/looter quest <ON|OFF> -- Toggles auto-loot for quest items.
```

Install
=======
You can install this addon in one of ~~two~~ **three** ways:

1. Download it on WoWInterface [here](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info23343-Semi-AutoLooter.html) and keep it automatically up-to-date (for free!) with [Minion](http://minion.mmoui.com/). **(Recommended)**
2. Clone this repository into **`<Your WoW Installation Directory>\Interface\AddOns\SemiautoLooter`**, checkout branch `stable` and update it occasionally.
3. Download [the latest release](https://github.com/smiley/semiauto/releases/latest) directly from GitHub and update manually.
