Semi-Auto Looter
========

A small add-on that auto-loots money & quest items.

Originally, I used auto-loot but my inventory became clogged by junk items VERY quickly, so I wrote a small add-on that will auto-loot only what I need.

If you don't want it to auto-loot some stuff (for whatever reason), you can configure it:

```
/looter money <ON|OFF> -- Toggles auto-loot for coins. (Not item currency)
/looter quest <ON|OFF> -- Toggles auto-loot for quest items.
```
